# Umbraco RFC Code of conduct

1. We respect the [”Our” code of conduct](https://our.umbraco.com/code-of-conduct)
2. Participants extend respect and courtesy to their community peers at all times. Treat others as you would like to be treated. This also goes for treating the Umbraco HQ with respect.
3. English is the primary language of the Umbraco community. However, it is not the native language of many community members. All participants, particularly those with English as a first language, attempt to accommodate the needs of other participants by communicating clearly, including speaking slowly and limiting the use of slang.
4. We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument rather than through intimidation or personal attack. Try to provide data and facts for your standpoints so the rest of the participants who are sitting on the sidelines watching the discussion can form an opinion. The discussion is easier when the response to a question is a polite answer.
5. Participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole community: project owners, engineers and end users; not the best solution for any particular technology, developer, partner or user.  
6. Individuals are prepared to contribute to the ongoing work of the group.
